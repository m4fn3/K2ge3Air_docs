## TrollStore Environment
> [!WARNING]
> If you are using the ipa for [TrollStore](https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-trollstore/), do not change the app ID from `jp.naver.line`. If you want to use a duplicated LINE app or change the app ID, please use the ipa for Sideloading, change the app ID, and then download it via TrollStore.

Please download the ipa for TrollStore from [here](https://github.com/m4fn3/K2ge3Air_docs/releases/tag/TrollStore) and install it via TrollStore.
> [!TIP]
> If you have already installed it from the App Store, you can switch to K2ge3Air while keeping your data by installing it with TrollStore and selecting "Force Installation".
> If any issues arise or if you want to revert to the official LINE app, you can safely restore it by reinstalling the LINE app from the App Store.

## Sideloading Environment
> [!WARNING]
> Please be very careful about certificate expiration when using Sideloading.

Please download the ipa for Sideloading from [here](https://github.com/m4fn3/K2ge3Air_docs/releases/tag/Sideloading) and install it using AltStore, Sideloadly, or similar tools. 

## Other Environments
### LiveContainer
Please download the ipa for Sideloading from [here](https://github.com/m4fn3/K2ge3Air_docs/releases/tag/Sideloading) and install it from within LiveContainer.

### TrollFools
> [!WARNING]
> Please use a version that supports deb injection. You may see a warning during deb injection, but it will work fine.
> If you want to inject into an app other than the official LINE app (`jp.naver.line`), please use the deb for Sideloading.

Please download the deb for TrollStore from [here](https://github.com/m4fn3/K2ge3Air_docs/releases/tag/Sideloading) and inject it into LINE via TrollFools.
